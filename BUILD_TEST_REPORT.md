# Build System Manual Testing Report - Issue #5

## Test Execution Date
June 27, 2025

## Test Environment
- **OS**: macOS (arm64)
- **CMake Version**: 3.x (determined via cmake --version)
- **Compiler**: AppleClang 15.0.0.15000309
- **vcpkg**: Available via Homebrew at /opt/homebrew/bin/vcpkg

## Test Case 1: Complete Clean Build Test

### ✅ Steps Completed Successfully:
- [x] No existing `build/` directory - clean state confirmed
- [x] `vcpkg_installed/` directory exists with packages
- [x] Created fresh build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`

### ❌ Critical Issue Found:
**CMAKE TOOLCHAIN CONFIGURATION PROBLEM**

#### Issue Details:
The project's CMakeLists.txt uses `find_package(raylib REQUIRED)` but the vcpkg-installed packages are not discoverable by CMake using standard methods.

#### Attempted Solutions:
1. **vcpkg toolchain file approach** (from issue instructions):
   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/share/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
   ```
   **Result**: ❌ FAILED - Toolchain file doesn't exist at expected location

2. **Direct CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH**:
   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx;../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/share" ..
   ```
   **Result**: ❌ FAILED - CMake still cannot find raylib config

3. **Explicit raylib_DIR**:
   ```bash
   cmake -Draylib_DIR=../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/share/raylib ..
   ```
   **Result**: ❌ FAILED - Config file exists but naming mismatch

4. **PKG_CONFIG approach**:
   ```bash
   export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/lib/pkgconfig:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH" && cmake ..
   ```
   **Result**: ❌ FAILED - CMake not configured to use pkg-config for raylib

#### Root Cause Analysis:
1. **Installed packages detected**:
   - ✅ raylib library: `../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/lib/libraylib.a`
   - ✅ raylib headers: `../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/include/raylib.h`
   - ✅ raylib pkg-config: `../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/lib/pkgconfig/raylib.pc`
   - ✅ raylib cmake config: `../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/share/raylib/raylib-config.cmake`

2. **CMake Configuration Mismatch**:
   - CMake expects: `raylibConfig.cmake` or `raylib-config.cmake`
   - Installed file: `raylib-config.cmake` (correct name)
   - Issue: CMake not searching in correct directories despite various PATH attempts

3. **Missing vcpkg integration**:
   - Project assumes vcpkg toolchain file availability
   - Current vcpkg installation (via Homebrew) lacks toolchain scripts
   - Need proper vcpkg root setup OR alternative configuration method

## Test Case 2: Dependency Resolution Test

### ❌ Cannot Proceed
Due to CMake configuration failure in Test Case 1, cannot test:
- vcpkg dependency installation correctness
- Raylib integration functionality
- Flecs ECS library linking
- JoltC physics library availability
- MSDF text rendering dependencies

## Test Case 3: CMake Configuration Test

### ❌ Critical Failures:
- CMake cannot find raylib package despite it being installed
- CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH not working as expected
- vcpkg toolchain file missing from current installation
- Package config files exist but are not discoverable

## Test Case 4: Examples Build Test

### ❌ Cannot Execute
Cannot test examples compilation due to failed main CMake configuration.

## Test Case 5: Build Artifacts Test

### ✅ Repository State Clean:
- [x] .gitignore excludes build files correctly
- [x] No build artifacts in git status (build/ directory not tracked)
- [x] Working tree clean before testing

## CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Issue #1: vcpkg Toolchain File Missing
**Severity**: Critical
**Description**: The CMake configuration in the issue instructions references a vcpkg toolchain file that doesn't exist in the current vcpkg installation.

**Expected Path**: `../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/share/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake`
**Actual Situation**: Path does not exist, files are in different structure

### Issue #2: CMake Package Discovery Failure
**Severity**: Critical  
**Description**: Despite raylib being properly installed via vcpkg with correct cmake config file, CMake cannot discover the package using standard find_package() mechanisms.

### Issue #3: Inconsistent Build Instructions
**Severity**: High
**Description**: The build instructions assume a vcpkg setup that doesn't match the actual project configuration.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix vcpkg integration** - Choose one approach:
   - **Option A**: Set up proper vcpkg root and update instructions
   - **Option B**: Modify CMakeLists.txt to work with current vcpkg installation format
   - **Option C**: Switch to different dependency management (Homebrew, manual)

2. **Update build documentation** to reflect working configuration

3. **Add CMake debugging** to help diagnose package discovery issues

### Proposed Solutions:
1. **CMakeLists.txt modification** to use vcpkg installed packages correctly
2. **Documentation update** with correct cmake configuration command
3. **CI/CD integration** to catch these issues automatically

## CONCLUSION

The manual testing successfully identified critical build system issues that prevent clean builds from scratch. The main problem is the mismatch between expected vcpkg integration and actual installed package structure.

**Test Result**: ❌ FAILED - Cannot complete clean build from scratch due to dependency discovery issues.

**Next Steps**: Address CMake configuration issues before proceeding with further development.
