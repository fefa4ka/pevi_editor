# Pevi Editor - Project Management Overview

## Project Status: FUNCTIONAL âœ…
*Last Updated: June 27, 2025*

### **What We Have Working:**
- âœ… **Core ECS Architecture**: Flecs ECS with proper component/system patterns
- âœ… **3D Text Rendering**: Billboard-style 3D text display with camera context
- âœ… **Navigation System**: Camera controls and 3D movement working
- âœ… **Input Handling**: Mouse/keyboard input for navigation mode
- âœ… **Examples Running**: Both simple and complete ECS examples functional
- âœ… **Build System**: CMake builds successfully on macOS ARM64

### **What We're Building:**
Pevi is a **3D spatial code editor** where code appears as floating "phantoms" (3D objects) arranged by **mnemonic sense** - meaning code is positioned in 3D space based on how developers naturally think about and remember relationships (call flow, data flow, hierarchy).

**Core Concept**: A single file is edited through multiple phantoms, each showing functions, classes, or logical blocks positioned intuitively in 3D space for better understanding and navigation.

## **Development Setup Status**

### **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX:**
1. **ðŸ”¥ Git Repository Chaos**
   - 27 unpushed commits sitting locally
   - Build artifacts (*.o files, CMakeFiles) being tracked in git
   - Working directory is dirty with build files

2. **ðŸ”¥ Missing Team Workflow**
   - No GitHub Issues for task management
   - No Pull Request workflow
   - No branch strategy for collaborative development

3. **ðŸ”¥ Documentation Redundancy**
   - Duplicate content in CLAUDE.md, TODO.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
   - No single source of truth for project state

---

## **Technology Stack**
- **Language**: C11
- **Graphics**: Raylib (3D rendering, input, windowing)
- **ECS**: Flecs (entity-component-system architecture)
- **Physics**: JoltC (planned)
- **UI**: ImGui (planned)
- **Build**: CMake with vcpkg for dependencies
- **Platform**: macOS ARM64 (primary), cross-platform goal

---

## **Current Architecture**
```
Application Layer: Lifecycle, configuration, system coordination
    â†“
Core Layer: Component framework, event system, spatial management
    â†“
Domain Layer: Text engine, phantom system, command processor
    â†“  
Services Layer: Renderer (Raylib), input, file I/O, UI
```

**Key Components:**
- **Phantoms**: 3D representations of code blocks positioned by mnemonic sense
- **Camera System**: 3D navigation with smooth controls
- **Text Engine**: Buffer management with 3D text rendering
- **Input System**: Mode-based input (navigation/edit/command)

---

## **Next Priority Actions**

### **Phase 1: Clean Up Repository (URGENT)**
1. Fix .gitignore to exclude build artifacts
2. Clean working directory of build files
3. Push the 27 commits to origin/master
4. Set up proper branch protection and PR workflow

### **Phase 2: Establish GitHub Workflow**
1. Create GitHub Issues for all TODO items
2. Set up branch protection requiring PR reviews
3. Create issue templates for bugs and features
4. Establish labeling system (bug, feature, enhancement, cleanup)

### **Phase 3: Consolidate Documentation**
1. Merge relevant content from CLAUDE.md and TODO.md into README.md
2. Keep ARCHITECTURE.md focused on technical architecture only
3. Remove redundant documentation files
4. Create clear development workflow documentation

### **Phase 4: Team Development Setup**
1. Create development guidelines for contributors
2. Set up CI/CD for automated builds and tests
3. Establish code review requirements
4. Create contributor guidelines

## **Active Development Areas**

### **Working and Ready for Feature Development:**
- Core ECS with proper component registration patterns
- 3D text rendering with billboard display
- Camera navigation with smooth controls
- Input handling for 3D interaction
- File structure with proper layered architecture

### **Next Features to Implement:**
1. **Edit Mode Input**: Text editing within phantoms
2. **Command System**: Basic command interface (:save, :load, etc.)
3. **File I/O Integration**: Load real code files into phantoms
4. **Selection System**: Visual feedback for selected phantoms
5. **Phantom Positioning**: Implement mnemonic sense algorithms

### **Technical Debt to Address:**
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Create unit tests for ECS components
- Performance optimization for large files
- Memory management improvements

---

## **Team Coordination Rules**

### **Code Flow (MUST FOLLOW):**
- **ALL code changes MUST go through Pull Requests**
- **NO direct commits to master branch**
- **Require at least 1 review before merge**
- **All PRs must have linked GitHub Issue**

### **Issue Management:**
- Break big features into small, actionable GitHub Issues
- Assign issues to prevent developers working on same code
- Close completed issues immediately
- Delete/close stale or duplicate issues weekly

### **Branch Strategy:**
- `master`: Production-ready code only
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/issue-123-description`: Feature branches linked to issues
- `bugfix/issue-456-description`: Bug fix branches

---

## **Development Commands**

### **Build and Run:**
```bash
# Full clean build
rm -rf build && mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../vcpkg_installed/arm64-osx/share/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run main editor
./build/editor

# Run working examples
./build/examples/ecs_complete/spatial_editor
./build/examples/ecs_complete/spatial_editor_simple
```

### **Git Workflow:**
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/issue-123-phantom-selection

# Regular commits during development
git add . && git commit -m "Implement phantom selection highlighting"

# Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/issue-123-phantom-selection
# Then create PR via GitHub UI
```

## **Naming Conventions**

### **Functions:** `object_action` or `object_subobject_action`
```c
phantom_create()              // Basic actions
phantom_text_content_set()    // Subobject actions
camera_target_phantom_set()   // Complex operations
```

### **Structs:** PascalCase types, snake_case instances
```c
typedef struct { float x, y, z; } Position;  // Type
Position phantom_position;                   // Instance
```

### **Files:** snake_case.h/.c in appropriate directories
```
include/pevi/phantom/text_content.h
src/phantom/text_content.c
```
